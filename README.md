## Overview

This Tableau project analyzes global CO₂ emissions, their relationship with economic growth, sectoral contributions, and the shift to renewable energy. The dashboard provides insights into historical trends, regional variations, and economic impacts on emissions, helping to inform sustainability efforts and policy decisions.

## Research Questions

* What are the trends in annual CO₂ emissions globally and by country over time?

* How has renewable energy generation evolved over time, and how does it vary by resource?

* What is the relationship between CO₂ emissions and renewable energy adoption across regions?

* How does economic status (GDP per capita) influence CO₂ emissions levels?

## Data Sources

* Our World in Data (Renewable Energy, CO₂ Emissions)

## Key Insights

* CO₂ Emissions Disparities: High-income countries tend to have higher per capita emissions, while lower-income nations contribute less but are more vulnerable to climate change.

* Renewable Energy Growth: While hydropower was historically dominant, solar and wind energy have seen rapid expansion in recent years.

* Economic Growth vs. Emissions: While GDP and emissions are often correlated, some high-income nations have successfully reduced emissions through sustainable energy policies.

* Negative Correlation Between Renewables & Emissions: Countries investing heavily in renewable energy tend to show a decline in CO₂ emissions over time.
